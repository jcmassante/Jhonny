    "text": "Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I am Jhonny Capichoni Massante, Aurora’s dad, Katy’s husband, and an ecologist.\nAfter many years thinking about creating a website, I think it has been over six year now, I finally got it! I hope I do not make it a place to only fill with professional information but also some creative things that sometimes happens to me.\nI am a post-doctoral research fellow in macroecology, currently working at University of São Paulo. It is hard to define my interests as I am interested in so many things, including, of course, ecology-related ones. I like to think it is a virtue: to be curious about things apparently no related. When I am not working on my postdoc project, I like to spend time with my daughter or reading books."

    "text": "“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one (George R. R. Martin)”\n\nIf I were asked: What do you most do? I would answer: I read! I read pretty much everything that crosses me. From medicines’ information to soap ingredients; from random poorly designed outdoors to every object’s manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards and like it. But of course, what I like the most is reading books, especially with dystopia themes. Recently, I have got an interest on books about mythology, and I am reading one about the hero’s journey. I also read books that are called self-help books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little everyday):\nThe first two books are not related. The first book The hero with a thousand faces is about the hero’s journey, a concept present in pretty much every book we read and film we watch. In this book the author Joseph Campbell presents a profound description of the hero’s journey. The human journey! The second book: Atomic habits: An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones is a best-seller about building new good habits and abandon bd ones. I’ve read another great book about habits, The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business, which describes the origin and cicle of habits with plenty of good examples. Atomic habits, however, is more a practical guide in my opinion and has been a revealing reading. Here are they:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also like very much reading mangas and watching animes. My favourite one is Naruto and this image represents it :). This is Rasengan, Naruto’s signature jutsu!\n\n\nThe hero with a thousand facesAtomic habits\n\n\n\n“This book show the hero’s journey and how it has been applied in stories for centuries.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This book helps creating new good habits and abandoning old bad ones.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next two books address academic writing. How to improve it. After a few years publishing scientific papers, dealing with reviewers comments, especially those like “there is high quality information in your discussion but it is buried among many other non-relevant information”. I find these comments extremely important and decided to seek for new ways of improving my academic writing. To start with, I picked two books: one about using storytelling and another about style. Here they are:\n\nHow to use storytelling in your academic writingThe elements of academic style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This book helps using storytelling and other techniques in academic writing.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This book is a guide to the elements of academic style. It offers techniques!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI am not selling anything here. It is just a list of books I am reading now!"
