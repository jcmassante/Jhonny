    "text": "Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I am Jhonny Capichoni Massante, Aurora’s dad, Katy’s husband, and an ecologist.\nAfter many years thinking about creating a website, I think it has been over six year now, I finally got it! I hope I do not make it a place to only fill with professional information but also some creative things that sometimes happens to me.\nI am a post-doctoral research fellow in macroecology, currently working at University of São Paulo. It is hard to define my interests as I am interested in so many things, including, of course, ecology-related ones. I like to think it is a virtue: to be curious about things apparently no related. When I am not working on my postdoc project, I like to spend time with my daughter or reading books."

    "text": "“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one (George R. R. Martin)”\n\nIf I were asked: What do you most do? I would answer: I read!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also like very much reading mangas and watching animes. My favourite one is Naruto and this image represents it :). This is Rasengan, Naruto’s signature jutsu!\n\nI read pretty much everything that crosses me. From medicines’ information to soap ingredients; from random poorly designed outdoors to every object’s manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards and like it. But of course, what I like the most is reading books, especially with dystopia themes. Recently, I have got an interest on books about mythology, and I am reading one about the hero’s journey. I also read books that are called self-help books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little everyday):\n\nThe hero with a thousand facesBook 2Book 3Book 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nother book\n\n\nanother book\n\n\nanother book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hero with a Thousand Faces"
