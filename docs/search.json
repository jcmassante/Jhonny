    "text": "How I became an Ecologist\n\n “Don’t give it up! keep it up! Turn it upside down!” (Kara no Kokoro, Anly) \n\nI am Brazilian, a dedicated father and husband. Unlike many colleagues, I had never dreamed of being an ecologist or anything related. As a kid, I would go to forest fragments near home to catch fruits and see mushrooms. I would also snick around plants to see insects while helping my father with gardening. But it never came to my mind to actually work with it. I was not the kind of kid that would have a collection of insects or do experiments with frogs. I just enjoyed being connected to that nature.\nI always wanted to be a Navy soldier. I never tried to be one, though. In my last high school year, I decided to be a Biologist. Not for doing research but to be a Biology Teacher. This idea came out after having Biology lectures that year. The new Biology Teacher would not use any supporting material in the classes, such as books or any other printed material, as every other teacher would. He simply would go to the board and write some topics. Then, he would discuss those topics with us. I got amazed by his didactics and wanted to be like him.\nWhile doing my graduate studies in Biology, I could not do intern-ships to practice my lecturing skills because I had to work; otherwise, I would have to quit. I worked in a big bank for over six years while studying Biology. No time for teaching. I felt bad as if I were throwing away my years of dedication. So, after discussing this issue with my wife, I decided to quit my job at the bank and start a Master’s degree in 2014. We had to change our lifestyle to be able to live with a Master’s scholarship. We struggled, but we managed it.\nWhile studying to obtain my Master’s degree, I had the chance to teach in high school. I was doing well, but life had other paths to show me. After applying for a PhD through Twitter, I moved to Estonia in 2016. Who would have thought? I was about to start a PhD in Ecology and 11,000 km away from my hometown. Of course, this story has many ups and downs, many moments in which I doubted myself and others in which people questioned my capacity. But I am not only curious; I am also stubborn.\n\n\n\nWhat I am doing now\nCurrently, I am the Principal Investigator of the project “Macroecology of rare species: global phylogenetic and functional patterns”. When I was about to defend my PhD in 2021, I decided to apply for a Personal Research Grant offered annually by the Estonian Research Council. They have a category of grants dedicated to people who have obtained a PhD degree from Estonian universities to develop research projects at foreign R&D institutions. Like many PhD students, I was afraid of not getting any job and had only one chance to get this Estonian funding. So, while writing the thesis, I came up with an idea about investigating the contribution of rare species to ecological communities.\nI got curious about rare species because I realised that my thesis discussed biodiversity patterns in ecological communities but focused on general patterns (without explicitly focusing on common or rare species). Common (and abundant) species are generally more studied than rare species. However, rare species are as important as common ones. And it was exciting to imagine their contribution to the assembly and functioning of ecological communities. So I sat down, wrote the project, and applied for the grant. In December 2021, I received an e-mail with the message “…your application has been approved”. I develop the project at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, in partnership with the University of Tartu, Estonia.\nAfter many years of thinking about creating a website (I think it has been over six years now), I finally got it! I intend to make it a place where I share professional information and some not job-related creative things that sometimes happen to me. This website would not have been created if there were no excellent free material from which I learned or adapted some CSS and HTML pieces of code. A special thanks goes to Sam Csik and Marvin Schmitt, and of course, people involved in the construction of Quarto."

I realised my innate sense of Curiosity serves as an asset throughout my professional journey. It has guided me through different career paths and seemingly unrelated projects.\nI’ve discovered that Biodiversity is the crucial link connecting my Curiosity to my academic interests. This connection becomes evident in the word cloud below. It showcases my academic contributions and the significance of Biodiversity in my research endeavours.\nWhen I am not at work, I like to stay with my family, travelling, hiking, and reading. Have a look at the books I am reading right now at Readings. Ah, I love sunsets!\nSince July 2022, I have been dedicated to developing a project centred around rare species and their contribution to ecological communities.

    "text": "“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one (George R. R. Martin)”\n\nIf I were asked: What do you most do? I would answer: I read! I read pretty much everything that crosses me. From medicines’ information to soap ingredients, from randomly poorly designed outdoors to every object’s manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards and like it. But of course, what I like the most is reading books, especially with dystopia themes. Recently, I have been interested in mythology books, and I am reading one about the hero’s journey. I also read books that are called self-help books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little every day):\nThe first two books are not related. The first book: The hero with a thousand faces, is about the hero’s journey, a concept present in pretty much every book we read and film we watch. In this book, the author Joseph Campbell presents a profound description of the hero’s journey. The human journey! The second book: Atomic habits: An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones is a best-seller about building new good habits and abandoning bad ones. I’ve read another great book about habits, The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business, which describes the origin and cycle of habits with plenty of good examples. Atomic habits, however, is more of a practical guide and has been a revealing reading. Here are they:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also like reading mangas and watching anime. My favourite one is Naruto, and this image represents it :). This is Rasengan, Naruto’s signature jutsu!\n\n\nThe hero with a thousand facesAtomic habits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTThe next two books address academic writing. How to improve it. After a few years of publishing scientific papers, dealing with reviewers’ comments, especially those like “there is high-quality information in your discussion, but it is buried among much other non-relevant information”. I find these comments extremely important and decided to seek new ways of improving my academic writing. To start with, I picked two books: one about using storytelling and another about style. Here they are:\n\nHow to use storytelling in your academic writingThe elements of academic style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI am not selling anything here. It is just a list of books I am reading now!"
