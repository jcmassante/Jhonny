##### Hi! Welcome to my personal website.  I am Jhonny Capichoni Massante, Aurora's dad, Katy's husband, and an ecologist.

After many years thinking about creating a website, I think it has been over six year now, I finally got it! I hope I do not make it a place to only fill with professional information but also some creative things that sometimes happens to me.

I am a post-doctoral research fellow in macroecology, currently working at University of SÃ£o Paulo. It is hard to define my interests as I am interested in so many things, including, of course, ecology-related ones. I like to think it is a virtue: to be curious about things apparently no related. When I am not working on my postdoc project, I like to spend time with my daughter or reading books.
