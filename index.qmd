Hi, my name is Jhonny and I am a post-doctoral research fellow in macroecology and the principal investigator of the project: " Macroecology of rare species: global phylogenetic and functional patterns". I got funding from the Estonian Research Council <https://etag.ee/en/> to develop the project at University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil in partnership with University of Tartu, Estonia.
