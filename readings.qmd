If I were asked: What do you most do? I would answer: **I read!**

Teaching MEDS students how to build their own personal websites using Quarto! This was especially fun for me, since Quarto was still such a new tool when I first gave this workshop -- it meant a lot of discovery and learning on-the-fly alongside our students.

I read pretty much everything that crosses me. From medicines' information to soap ingredients; from random poorly designed outdoors to every object's manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards and like it. But of course, what I like the most is reading books, especially with dystopia themes. Recently, I have got an interest on books about mythology, and I am reading one about the hero's journey. I also read books that are called *self-help* books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little everyday):
