##### "*A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one* (George R. R. Martin)"

If I were asked: What do you most do? I would answer: **I read!** I read pretty much everything that crosses me. From medicines' information to soap ingredients, from randomly poorly designed outdoors to every object's manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards and like it. But of course, what I like the most is reading books, especially with dystopia themes. Recently, I have been interested in mythology books, and I am reading one about the hero's journey. I also read books that are called *self-help* books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little every day):

The first two books are not related. The first book: [The hero with a thousand faces](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PPV6VP6LT37E&keywords=the+hero+with+a+thousand+faces&qid=1686068024&s=books&sprefix=the+hero%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C318&sr=1-1), is about the hero's journey, a concept present in pretty much every book we read and film we watch. In this book, the author *Joseph Campbell* presents a profound description of the hero's journey. The human journey! The second book: [Atomic habits: An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones](https://www.amazon.com.br/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) is a best-seller about building new good habits and abandoning bad ones. I've read another great book about habits, [The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X), which describes the origin and cycle of habits with plenty of good examples. Atomic habits, however, is more of a practical guide and has been a revealing reading. Here are they:

I also like reading mangas and watching anime. My favourite one is Naruto, and this image represents it :). This is Rasengan, Naruto's signature jutsu!

TThe next two books address academic writing. How to improve it. After a few years of publishing scientific papers, dealing with reviewers' comments, especially those like "there is high-quality information in your discussion, but it is buried among much other non-relevant information". I find these comments extremely important and decided to seek new ways of improving my academic writing. To start with, I picked two books: one about using storytelling and another about style. Here they are:

I am not selling anything here. It is just a list of books I am reading now!
