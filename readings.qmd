##### "*A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one* (George R. R. Martin)"

If I were asked: What do you most do? I would answer: **I read!** I read pretty much everything that crosses me. From medicines' information to soap ingredients; from random poorly designed outdoors to every object's manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards and like it. But of course, what I like the most is reading books, especially with dystopia themes. Recently, I have got an interest on books about mythology, and I am reading one about the hero's journey. I also read books that are called *self-help* books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little everyday):

The first two books are not related. The first book [The hero with a thousand faces](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PPV6VP6LT37E&keywords=the+hero+with+a+thousand+faces&qid=1686068024&s=books&sprefix=the+hero%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C318&sr=1-1) is about the hero's journey, a concept present in pretty much every book we read and film we watch. In this book the author *Joseph Campbell* presents a profound description of the hero's journey. The human journey! The second book: [Atomic habits: An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones](https://www.amazon.com.br/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) is a best-seller about building new good habits and abandon bd ones. I've read another great book about habits, [The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X), which describes the origin and cicle of habits with plenty of good examples. Atomic habits, however, is more a practical guide in my opinion and has been a revealing reading. Here are they:

I also like very much reading mangas and watching animes. My favourite one is Naruto and this image represents it :). This is Rasengan, Naruto's signature jutsu!

The next two books address academic writing. How to improve it. After a few years publishing scientific papers, dealing with reviewers comments, especially those like "there is high quality information in your discussion but it is buried among many other non-relevant information". I find these comments extremely important and decided to seek for new ways of improving my academic writing. To start with, I picked two books: one about using storytelling and another about style. Here they are:

## The elements of academic style

.justify {
  text-align: right !important
}
```

::: {.right}

"This book is a guide to the elements of academic style. It offers techniques!"
