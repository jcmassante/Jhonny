I am Aurora's dad, Katy's husband, and an ecologist currently working as a post-doctoral researcher in macroecology.\n\n<br>\n\nI am a curious person. We are all born curious. I realised my innate sense of **Curiosity** serves as an asset throughout my professional journey. It has guided me through different career paths and seemingly unrelated projects.\n\nI've discovered that **Biodiversity** is the crucial link connecting my **Curiosity** to my academic interests. This connection becomes evident in the word cloud below. It showcases my academic contributions and the significance of **Biodiversity** in my research endeavours.\n\nWhen I am not at work, I like to stay with my family, travelling, hiking, and reading. Have a look at the books I am reading right now at *Readings*. Ah, I love sunsets!\n\nSince July 2022, I have been dedicated to developing a project centred around rare species and their contribution to ecological communities. For more details, have a look at *About*.\n\n##### My academic interests in a word cloud\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size: small\">\n\nWord cloud made with the abstracts of scientific papers I have published, either as a first author or as a collaborator.\n\n</p>\n",
