The \"one\" who never reads lives only one* (George R. R. Martin)\"\n\n<br>\n\nIf I were asked: What do you do most of your time? I would answer: **I read!** I read everything that crosses me. From medicines' information to soap ingredients, from randomly poorly designed outdoors to every object's manual of instructions. The craziest part? I very often catch myself reading words backwards. But books are the top reading, especially dystopias, fantastic, and classics. Recently, I have been interested in mythology books. I am reading one about the hero's journey. I also like *self-help* books and books about creativity and writing. Here are the four books I am currently reading (a little every day):\n\nThe first two books are not related. The first book: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=jcmassante0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=eeae5cafa35a288648e7ef999ca84f97&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=The hero with a thousand faces\">The hero with a thousand faces</a>, is about the hero's journey, a concept present in almost every book we read and film we watch. In this book, the author *Joseph Campbell* describes the hero's journey. The human journey! The second book: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=jcmassante0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e96707c1e8442b5597b4740e045169c4&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=Atomic habits: An easy &amp; proven way to build good habits &amp; break bad ones\">Atomic habits: An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones</a> is a best-seller about building new good habits and abandoning bad ones. I've read another great book about habits, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=jcmassante0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=8908c558c784836bad17d8241fd7967f&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business\">The power of habit: Why we do what we do in life and business</a>, which describes the origin and cycle of habits with plenty of good examples. Atomic habits, however, is more of a practical guide and has been a revealing reading. Here are they:\n\n::: {.column-margin .right}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](rasengan.png){width=274}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<div>\n\nI also like reading mangas and watching anime. My favourite one is Naruto, and this image represents it :). This is Rasengan, Naruto's signature jutsu!\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The hero with a thousand faces\n\n::: right\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hero-of-thousand-faces.png){width=226}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Atomic habits\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.justify {\n  text-align: left !important\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\n::: left\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](atomic.png){fig-align='center' width=197}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n\nThe next two books address academic writing and how to improve it. I have been publishing scientific papers for a few years now. Sometimes I had to deal with reviewers' comments like \"There is high-quality information in your discussion, but it is buried among much other non-relevant information\". These comments were extremely important because they made me realise I had to do something different about academic writing and improve it. In addition to critically reading others' papers, I picked two books to help me out: one about using storytelling in academic writing: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=jcmassante0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f4611f6932b06845abd2166eb12ecb11&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=How to use storytelling in your academic writing: techniques for engaging readers and successfully navigating the writing and publishing processes\">How to use storytelling in your academic writing: techniques for engaging readers and successfully navigating the writing and publishing processes</a> and another about style: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=jcmassante0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=1bedb2c53eb849e537604aed4910b548&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=The elements of academic style: writing for the humanities\">The elements of academic style: writing for the humanities</a>.\n\nWriting is an extremely hard process for anyone; writing academic texts in another language is even harder. So, I plan to work on my next publications doing my best to implement the tips I find in these books. Here they are:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## How to use storytelling in your academic writing\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.justify {\n  text-align: left !important\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\n::: left\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](storytelling.png){fig-align='left' width=214}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The elements of academic style\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.justify {\n  text-align: right !important\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\n::: right\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](elements.png){fig-align='center' width=201}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you happen to purchase any of these books through the provided links, I may receive a small commission.\n:::\n",
